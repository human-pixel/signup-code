## Usage

Signup Code blocks visitors from registering a new site or user account without providing a custom, network specific, signup code.

Add a simple, effective layer of protection and ensure only specific people can create new users or sites. Designed to compliment any Multisite configuration and work flawlessly with other third-party plugins.

### Configuration is fast...really fast

Set a signup code and your new protection wall will automatically be added to the network signup page. The simplicity makes it easy to set, reset or change your code frequently; all while enhancing security. 

Use in combination with the Multisite Privacy plugin and manage exactly who is able to register creating a truly exclusive and private network. From the business sector to the classroom, Multisite is a powerful tool for development and training. Protect internal communication or create a safe learning environment by limiting access to only team members or students.

### Designed to match

Signup Code scans key style elements from your theme and conforms to match for a seamless fit. Both the administrative settings and the front-end interface conform for a user experience that feels native to WordPress core.
